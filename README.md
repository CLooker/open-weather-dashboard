# Context

I created this project in a few days at the behest of a job posting. The summary of what was requested is as follows:

Use <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">the open weather API</a> to create a React dashboard.

The user wants to be able to view some weather for Rome, Italy. Specifically, the user wants to be able to view:

1. The current forecast.

2. A summary of the five day forecast.

3. An air quality report.

4. The ability to create a weather alert when the temperature exceeds a certain temperature, as well as the ability to receive information that an alert has been triggered.

5. The ability to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
