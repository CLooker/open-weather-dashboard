# Context

I created this project in a few days at the behest of a job posting. I secured the job with this project, and over time I've come back and made the code better.

The summary of what was requested is as follows:

Use <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">the OpenWeather API</a> to create a React dashboard.

The user wants to be able to view weather for Rome, Italy. Specifically, the user wants to be able to:

1. View the current weather.

2. View a summary of the five day forecast.

3. View an air quality report.

4. Create a weather alert when the temperature exceeds a certain temperature, as well as the ability to receive information that an alert has been triggered.

5. Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
